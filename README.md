# Sims-CC-Unzip
A program to automatically unzip folders of downloaded CC

There are a few steps prior to using this program:
1) Download Python (in your terminal, type 'python' and download it from the microsoft store)
2) Create a new folder in your directory for unzipping (in your terminal, type 'mkdir folderName')
3) Place this python file into the new folder
4) place any zipped folders of downloaded CC into the new folder
5) Run the python program (in your terminal, type 'python unzipCC.py')

Note:
The program will ask you to create a name for a subfolder. This subfolder is created inside of the parent folder you had just created.
Typically, this subfolder is named by the date you downloaded the CC.

After the program is complete, the subfolder is moved to your mods folder for the Sims 4.
